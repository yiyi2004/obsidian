## Highlights
- Pre-trained weights in deepface were stored in Google Drive source but it has a daily download limit. Users can get "Too many users have viewed or downloaded this file recently. Please try accessing the file again later" often. That's why, pre-trained weights are going to be stored in this repo as a release. — [Updated on 2023-05-26 21:46:43](https://hyp.is/v8whyPvLEe2qy1vUJgmLmw/github.com/serengil/deepface_models) — Group: #Public
