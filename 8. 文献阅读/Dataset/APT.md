>The APT Malware dataset is used to train classifiers to predict if a given malware belongs to the “Advanced Persistent Threat” (APT) type or not. It contains 3131 samples spread over 24 different unique malware classes.

> These datasets are made available to academia and industry to promote research and inquiry, representing the execution logs of 9,376, 2,195 APT samples respectively.
> - APT-EXE execution logs contain 24 primary feature categories. These categories are Imports, Runtime DLLs, Registry Set, Registry Set Value, Registry Set Type, Registry Deleted, Service (Opened, Controlled, Created, Started), Process (Terminated, Created, Injected), Shell Commands, File (Read, Opened, Written, Replaced, Deleted, Moved and Copy source and destination), and additionally respective DLLs and functions called.
> - The APT-DLL dataset represents two feature categories of DLLs and functions called.
> - The APT-IoC dataset contains 21,986 log records across 57 file types.

- [Dataset of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) alerts](https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/dataset/Dataset_of_Advanced_Persistent_Threat_APT_alerts/7577750)
>Due to the lack of publicly available data of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) traffic, we built a synthetic dataset which contains APT alerts. This dataset contains 3676 APT alerts that belong to 1000 APT campaigns. The APT alerts were generated to simulate APT scenarios targeting a university campus network. Each APT scenario takes into consideration the following steps of APT life cycle:
>1. Intelligence gathering
>2. Point of entry
>3. Command and control communication
>4. Lateral movement
>5. Asset discovery
>6. Data exfiltration
