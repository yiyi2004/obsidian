Thank you for confirming. Let's proceed with a detailed review of your work experience to enhance your resume.

1. **中国科学院自动化所 (June 2023 - December 2023):**
   - The responsibilities you've listed are quite comprehensive. However, it's important to focus on **results** and **achievements** rather than just duties. For example, if you developed a database, mention the impact it had, like **improved data retrieval speed or increased storage capacity**.
   - Use **diverse** action verbs to begin each bullet point. This adds dynamism to your descriptions and showcases a variety of skills.
   - Ensure that the content is original and meaningful, avoiding overused buzzwords or clichés.
   - Check for any spelling errors or inconsistent verb tenses to maintain professionalism.
2. **Payload Activation Program Generation Software (June 2023 - December 2023):**
   - This project description is quite technical. While it's good to showcase your technical skills, it might be beneficial to also explain the impact or success of the project **in more accessible terms**. For instance, **how did this software benefit the end user or the organization**?
   - The bullet points should be concise but detailed enough to convey your role and the importance of your contribution.
3. **Intrusion Detection System based on ATT&CK (January 2023 - March 2023):**
   - Again, focusing on the outcomes of your work will be more impactful. For example, did your work on the intrusion detection system lead to a decrease in security incidents?
   - Make sure the bullet points are not too lengthy and are easy to read, balancing detail with conciseness.
