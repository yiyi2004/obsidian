## Page Notes
## Highlights
- this is a prototype of a "junior developer" agent (aka smol dev) that scaffolds an entire codebase out for you once you give it a product spec, but does not end the world or overpromise AGI. instead of making and maintaining specific, rigid, one-shot starters, like create-react-app, or create-nextjs-app, this is basically create-anything-app where you develop your scaffolding prompt in a tight loop with your smol dev. — [Updated on 2023-05-18 18:15:13](https://hyp.is/xOuzmPVkEe2hO0M2FqAHrQ/github.com/smol-ai/developer) — Group: #Public
