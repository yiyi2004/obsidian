## 自我介绍
### 英文自我介绍
Good morning. I am glad to be here for this interview. First let me introduce myself. My name is  ZhangCe. I come from  Shen Yang, the capital of  Liao Ning Province. I graduated from the North China Electric Power University，a university of Project 211. In the past one years I have been prepareing for the postgraduate examination, Now all my hard work has got a result since I have a chance to be interview by you .

During my  college life, I once served as the team leader of the technical community,  mainly responsible for the progress of the project, assigning learning tasks, and sharing technology sometimes. In the process of participating in community activities, I received a lot of goods and learned technologies for example, the programming language Golang, the web framwork: Gin, also, I learned many front-end techs such as JS, React and Ant-Design. Totaly, I love our community and I not only learn knowledge and skills from it, but also I gain the precious friendships。

In the process of preparing for the re-examination, I read some cybersecurity-related literature, understood the current state of cybersecurity, and worked hard to learn techniques that might be used in graduate studies, such as Python, basic methods of machine learning and deep learning and so on.

I always believe that one will easily lag behind unless he keeps on learning. Of course, if I am given a chance to study cyberspace security in this famous University, I will stare no effort to master konwledge and techs, and make my own contribution to my country.。

### 中文自我介绍：

老师们早上好，很高兴来到这里参加这次面试，我叫张策，我来自辽宁沈阳，我是本科就读于华北电力大学计算机科学与技术的应届生。

首先，我注重加强专业知识的基础，脚踏实地，并高分通过了许多课程，如软件工程、线性代数等。同时我注重实践，在计算机网络、软件工程等实践课程中均取得优的评价。我通过了六级考试，选修过计算机专业英语，并以 85 分通过考试，为阅读文献打下良好基础。

其次，在业余时间，我喜欢研究一些自己感兴趣的事情，并为之努力，比如我自学了 python、go 等编程语言和相关框架。我喜欢打乒乓球和跑步，这锻炼了我的竞技精神和耐力，并且为日后读书、做科研铸就健康体魄。

而且，我有较好的抗压能力和团队协作能力，去年夏天到了考研复习的关键时期，我需要实现一个基于 web 的考试系统。作为组长，我通过前后端分离来降低功能模块之间的耦合度，便于分配。由于时间优先，我选择利用 Gin 和 React、Ant-Design 来缩短项目周期，最终取得了优异的成绩。

最重要的是，北邮被称为信息黄埔，网安专业在 2021 的软科排名为全国前 5%，我深深地被这种学术分为所吸引，我认为自己具备了专业所需的基本素质。虽然我在很多方面都有广泛兴趣，但我的工作只是做一些表面的事情，因此希望能来北邮网安深入研究一个具体的方向，继续深造。若能够在北邮这个我一直梦想的学校，跟着老师们继续学习，这正是我的荣幸。

Google 转英文：
Good morning teachers, I am very happy to be here for this interview, my name is Zhang Ce, I am from Shenyang, Liaoning, I am a fresh graduate of North China Electric Power University in Computer Science and Technology.

First of all, I focus on strengthening the foundation of professional knowledge, keep my feet on the ground, and pass many courses with high marks, such as software engineering, linear algebra, etc. At the same time, I pay attention to practice, and have achieved excellent evaluation in practical courses such as computer network and software engineering. I passed the CET-6 exam, took English for Computer Science as an elective, and passed the exam with a score of 85, laying a good foundation for reading literature.

Secondly, in my spare time, I like to study some things which I am interested in and work hard for them. For example, I have taught myself programming languages such as python and go and related frameworks. I like playing table tennis and jogging, which have exercised my competitive spirit and stamina, and created a healthy body for reading and doing scientific research in the future.

Moreover, I have good pressure resistance and teamwork ability. Last summer, when it was a critical period for postgraduate examination and review, I needed to implement a web-based examination system. As the team leader, I reduce the coupling between functional modules by separating the front and back ends for easy assignment. Due to the priority of time, I chose to use Gin and React, Ant-Design to shorten the project cycle, and finally achieved excellent results.

The most important thing is that Beiyou is called Information Huangpu, and the network security major will be ranked among the top 5% in 2021. I am deeply attracted by this academic classification, and I think I have the basics required for the major. Quality. Although I have broad interests in many aspects, my work is only superficial, so I hope to come to Beiyou Network Security to study a specific direction and continue my studies. It is my honor to be able to continue my studies with the teachers in Beiyou, the school I have always dreamed of.

## 常见英语问题
问题一：你为什么考研？
There are several reasons.
I have been deeply impressed by the academic atmosphere when I came here last summer. In my opinion, as one of the most famous university in our country, 这里介绍一下北邮的情况 it provide people with enough room to get further enrichment. This is the first reason.

The second one is I am long for doing research in cyberspace security throughout my life. 

Thirdly, I learnt a lot from my job during the past two years. However, I think further study is still  urgent for me to realize self-value. Life is precious. It is necessary to seize any chance for self-development, especially in this competitive modern world. 我这个人比较贪心，我有两个梦想，一个是当一名老师，另一个是当科学家，小的时候觉得老师很厉害，你问他们什么，他们都会。关于为什么相当科学家，仅仅是因为在我那个时期，大家都想当科学家，这是一份令人尊敬的职业。考研可能是为数不多我可以一次完成两个梦想的机会，所以我选择了考研。
In a word, I am looking forward to making a solid foundation for future profession after three years study here.
