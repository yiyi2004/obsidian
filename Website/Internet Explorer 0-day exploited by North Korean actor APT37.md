- The document downloaded a rich text file (RTF) remote template, which in turn fetched remote HTML content. Because Office renders this HTML content using Internet Explorer (IE), this technique has been widely used to distribute IE exploits via Office files since 2017 (e.g. CVE-2017-0199). Delivering IE exploits via this vector has the advantage of not requiring the target to use Internet Explorer as its default browser, nor to chain the exploit with an EPM sandbox escape. — [Updated on 2023-05-30 11:06:56](https://hyp.is/4VJXVP6WEe2cWi8PsbQg9g/blog.google/threat-analysis-group/internet-explorer-0-day-exploited-by-north-korean-actor-apt37/) — Group: #Public

- Upon investigation, TAG observed the attackers abused an 0-day vulnerability in the JScript engine of Internet Explorer. — [Updated on 2023-05-30 11:07:10](https://hyp.is/EU1fEv6XEe2exRdqSf0hYA/blog.google/threat-analysis-group/internet-explorer-0-day-exploited-by-north-korean-actor-apt37/) — Group: #Public

- The vulnerability resides within “jscript9.dll”, the JavaScript engine of Internet Explorer, and can be exploited to execute arbitrary code when rendering an attacker-controlled website. — [Updated on 2023-05-30 11:07:55](https://hyp.is/LFL8aP6XEe271u9JtL58ow/blog.google/threat-analysis-group/internet-explorer-0-day-exploited-by-north-korean-actor-apt37/) — Group: #Public

- In a typical delivery scenario, the initial document would have the Mark-of-the-Web applied. This means the user has to disable protected view before the remote RTF template is fetched. — [Updated on 2023-05-30 11:08:21](https://hyp.is/O_uUrv6XEe2SyV_vAMQGCA/blog.google/threat-analysis-group/internet-explorer-0-day-exploited-by-north-korean-actor-apt37/) — Group: #Public

- Additionally it reports twice to the C2 server: before launching the exploit and after the exploit succeeds. — [Updated on 2023-05-30 11:09:13](https://hyp.is/WvikWv6XEe2XgaNOFwxubg/blog.google/threat-analysis-group/internet-explorer-0-day-exploited-by-north-korean-actor-apt37/) — Group: #Public

- The delivered shellcode uses a custom hashing algorithm to resolve Windows APIs. The shellcode erases all traces of exploitation by clearing the Internet Explorer cache and history before downloading the next stage. The next stage is downloaded using the same cookie that was set when the server delivered the remote RTF. — [Updated on 2023-05-30 11:09:56](https://hyp.is/dIMRbP6XEe2heNeZIsNcDA/blog.google/threat-analysis-group/internet-explorer-0-day-exploited-by-north-korean-actor-apt37/) — Group: #Public
