# The Loader
Having a plugin is useless if it never actually manages to run. Something needs to load the Plugin to start executing its code.

There are a lot of techniques available to actually make this happen — two methods are:
- Plugin-driven, where the plugin knows how to access the program and self-registers.
- Program-driven, where the program knows how to find plugins and loads any it finds.

In plugin-driven loading approaches, the program provides a method by which the plugin can register itself with the program. In program-driven loading approaches, the program finds a plugin, such as by loading all files in a folder with the name`*_plugin`or by loading a manifest.
