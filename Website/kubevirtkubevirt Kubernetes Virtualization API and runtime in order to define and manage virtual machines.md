## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Virtualization extension for Kubernetes At its core, KubeVirt extends Kubernetes by adding additional virtualization resource types (especially the VM type) through Kubernetes's Custom Resource Definitions API. By using this mechanism, the Kubernetes API can be used to manage these VM resources alongside all other resources Kubernetes provides. The resources themselves are not enough to launch virtual machines. For this to happen the functionality and business logic needs to be added to the cluster. The functionality is not added to Kubernetes itself, but rather added to a Kubernetes cluster by running additional controllers and agents on an existing cluster. — [Updated on 2023-05-23 18:16:52](https://hyp.is/7-5dOPlSEe27z-ehKzyrZA/github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt) — Group: #Public
