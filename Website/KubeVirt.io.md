## Highlights
- KubeVirt technology addresses the needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt Kubernetes but possess existing Virtual Machine-based workloads that cannot be easily containerized. More specifically, the technology provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both Application Containers as well as Virtual Machines in a common, shared environment. — [Updated on 2023-05-23 18:16:32](https://hyp.is/4_2UCPlSEe2Y1csazfY7Ig/kubevirt.io//) — Group: #Public
